# Contributing to Roach

This is the Contribution Guide for Roach PHP. Please read this document
carefully before opening an issue or a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

Before contributing to the project, please read our 
[Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting a bug

Before you submit an issue, please search [the issue tracker][issues]. An issue
for your problem might already exist and the discussion might inform you of
workarounds readily available.

You can file new issues by [selecting an issue template][new-issue] and filling
out the necessary information.

## Proposing a Change

If you intend to change the public API or make any non-trivial changes to the
implementation, make sure to [create an issue][new-feature] first. This will let 
us discuss a proposal before you put significant effort into it.

If you're only fixing a bug or a typo, it's fine to submit a pull request right
away without creating an issue, but make sure it contains a clear and concise
description of the bug.

## Working on Issues

Before you start working on an issue make sure that it has been accepted
(indicated by an [`accepted`][label-accepted] label) and that no one has
claimed it yet. Otherwise, you may duplicate other people's efforts. If somebody
claims an issue but doesn't follow up for more than two weeks, itâ€™s fine to take
it over, but you should still leave a comment. You should also leave a comment
on any issue you're working on, to let others know.

## Semantic Versioning

Roach follows [semantic versioning][semver].

## Making a Pull Request

1. Fork the roach-php/core repo.
2. In your forked repo, create a new branch for your changes:
   ```shell
   git checkout -b my-fix-branch main
   ```
3. Update the code. **Make sure that all your changes are covered by tests.**
4. Commit your changes using a **descriptive commit message** that follows the
   [Angular Commit Message Conventions][commit-format].
   ```shell
   git commit --all
   ```
5. Push your branch to GitHub:
   ```shell
   git push origin my-fix-branch
   ```
6. In GitHub, send a pull request to [the main branch][main].

### Addressing review feedback

1. Make required updates to the code.
2. Create a fixup commit and push it to your GitHub repo:
   ```shell
   git commit --all --fixup HEAD
   git push
   ```
